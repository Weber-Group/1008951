# CXI-1008951 Fast Analysis
Working repo for the 1008951 attosecond timing with hard xrays beamtime.

## Goals of the Fast Analysis
1. Provide live (or at least quick) information on pump probe overlap for efficient use of beamtime.
2. Fast analysis of the CVMI Data
3. Fast analysis of the all-optical phase tagging data
4. Instrumental monitoring. (Drifts, misaligments, pressures, powers, etc.)

### Open Questions:
1. Will we be using the smalldata producer files with this beamtime? If so, what will be included in the preprocessing?
2. Do we want to have live output on the hutch computer for t0 finding similar to that of the shared memory setup for gas phase experiments? Is this too cumbersome to set up?
3. Will we be doing the pulse reconstruction algorithm on the CVMI data?
4. What is the workup like for the all-optical phase tagging?
